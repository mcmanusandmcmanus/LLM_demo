Once upon a time, a curious engineer built a tiny language model to learn how machines write.
The model was patient, training on countless lines until it could finish a sentence with confidence.
Small models are like sketches; they are fast to try and easy to debug before painting the full picture.
Building an LLM involves tokenizing text, batching it efficiently, and optimizing the parameters step by step.
With every epoch, the model grows a little wiser, shaping its predictions from feedback and loss curves.
